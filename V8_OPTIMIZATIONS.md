# V8-Style JSON Stringify Optimizations for aarch64

This document describes the V8-inspired optimizations implemented in the aarch64 SIMD JSON string escaping code.

## Overview

The optimizations are based on the core V8 insight: **optimize for the common case where most data needs NO escaping**. Rather than trying to vectorize escape processing, we use SIMD for fast detection and bulk copy operations for clean data.

## Key Optimizations Implemented

### 1. Fast Clean Detection with SIMD
- **Approach**: Use NEON SIMD to rapidly check 64-byte chunks for escape characters
- **Implementation**: Single SIMD operation checks for: 
  - Control characters: `< 0x20`
  - Quote character: `== 0x22`
  - Backslash character: `== 0x5C`
- **Benefit**: Quickly identifies clean chunks that can be bulk-copied

### 2. Bulk Copy for Clean Data
- **Strategy**: When entire chunks need no escaping, copy them in bulk
- **Implementation**: `extend_from_slice()` for maximum efficiency
- **Benefit**: Avoids character-by-character processing for clean text

### 3. Minimal Overhead Design
- **Philosophy**: Keep the hot path (clean data) as lightweight as possible
- **Implementation**: Simple chunk scanning with immediate bulk copy
- **Benefit**: Reduces unnecessary work in the common case

### 4. Proven Scalar Fallback
- **Strategy**: When escapes are detected, fall back to the optimized scalar implementation
- **Implementation**: Use existing `encode_str_inner()` for dirty chunks
- **Benefit**: Avoids complexity and overhead of SIMD escape processing

## Performance Characteristics

### Expected Improvements on aarch64
1. **Clean Text Workloads**: 15-40% improvement due to bulk copy operations
2. **Mixed Content**: 10-25% improvement from efficient clean chunk detection
3. **Cache Efficiency**: Better memory access patterns with 64-byte chunks
4. **Lower CPU Usage**: Reduced instruction count for common cases

### Memory Efficiency
- No memory overhead from escape tables or complex data structures
- Simple capacity estimation avoids over-allocation
- Efficient bulk operations reduce memory bandwidth usage

## Architecture-Specific Features

### aarch64 NEON Optimizations
- Uses `vld1q_u8_x4` for efficient 64-byte loads
- Leverages NEON comparison operations (`vcltq_u8`, `vceqq_u8`)
- Optimized for ARM Neoverse V1/V2 and Apple Silicon processors

### Cache-Friendly Design
- 64-byte processing chunks align with common cache line sizes
- Sequential memory access patterns for better prefetching
- Reduced random memory access during clean chunk detection

## Real-World Performance

The implementation is tested against the AFFiNE v0.23.2 codebase:
- **Dataset**: 6,448 JavaScript/TypeScript files (22MB)
- **Content**: Production React/TypeScript code with realistic escape patterns
- **CI Testing**: Automated benchmarking on ARM Neoverse V1/V2 hardware

## Compatibility

- ✅ Full backward compatibility with existing API
- ✅ Identical output to `serde_json::to_string()`
- ✅ Only affects aarch64 builds (other architectures use fallback)
- ✅ No breaking changes to public interface

## Why This Approach Works

The V8 team discovered that most JSON strings contain large sections of text that need no escaping. By optimizing for this common case:

1. **Clean chunks**: Fast SIMD detection + bulk copy = maximum performance
2. **Dirty chunks**: Fall back to proven scalar code = reliable performance
3. **Mixed workloads**: Get benefits from both approaches automatically

This strategy avoids the complexity and overhead of trying to vectorize escape processing, which often adds more overhead than benefit.
