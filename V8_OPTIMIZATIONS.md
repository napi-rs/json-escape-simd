# V8-Style JSON Stringify Optimizations for aarch64

This document describes the V8-inspired optimizations implemented in the aarch64 SIMD JSON string escaping code.

## Overview

The optimizations are based on techniques used in V8's high-performance JSON.stringify implementation, adapted for Rust and aarch64 NEON SIMD instructions.

## Key Optimizations Implemented

### 1. Bit-based Character Classification
- **Before**: Used table lookup (`vqtbl4q_u8`) with a 256-byte escape table
- **After**: Uses bit operations to classify characters needing escape:
  - Control characters: `< 0x20`
  - Quote character: `== 0x22`
  - Backslash character: `== 0x5C`
- **Benefit**: Reduced memory footprint and better cache efficiency

### 2. ASCII Fast Path Detection
- **New**: `is_ascii_clean_chunk()` function to quickly identify chunks that need no escaping
- **Implementation**: Single SIMD pass to check if entire 64-byte chunk is clean
- **Benefit**: Bulk copy for clean text, avoiding character-by-character processing

### 3. Advanced Memory Prefetching
- **Before**: Single prefetch instruction `PREFETCH_DISTANCE` ahead
- **After**: Dual prefetch instructions covering more cache lines
- **Configuration**: Prefetch 6 chunks (384 bytes) ahead instead of 4 chunks (256 bytes)
- **Benefit**: Better memory latency hiding for larger datasets

### 4. Optimized String Building
- **Smart Capacity Estimation**: 
  - Small strings (< 1024 bytes): Conservative allocation to avoid waste
  - Large strings: Estimate based on expected escape ratio
- **Reduced Reallocations**: Better initial capacity reduces memory allocations during processing

### 5. Vectorized Escape Processing
- **New**: `process_escape_vector()` function for SIMD-aware escape generation
- **Optimized Escape Generation**: `write_escape_optimized()` with reduced branching
- **Benefit**: Faster escape sequence generation with better branch prediction

### 6. Reduced Branching Architecture
- **Before**: Macro-based approach with complex conditional logic
- **After**: Linear processing with predictable branch patterns
- **Implementation**: Separate fast/slow paths with minimal conditional jumps

## Performance Characteristics

### Expected Improvements
1. **Clean ASCII Text**: 40-60% improvement due to fast path
2. **Mixed Content**: 20-30% improvement from better memory access patterns
3. **Heavy Escaping**: 15-25% improvement from optimized escape generation
4. **Large Strings**: 30-50% improvement from better prefetching

### Memory Efficiency
- Reduced memory allocations through smart capacity estimation
- Better cache utilization through optimized data access patterns
- Lower memory bandwidth usage due to efficient SIMD operations

## Architecture-Specific Features

### aarch64 NEON Optimizations
- Uses native aarch64 SIMD intrinsics for maximum performance
- Leverages NEON's efficient comparison and masking operations
- Optimized for modern aarch64 processors (Apple Silicon, AWS Graviton, etc.)

### Cache-Friendly Design
- 64-byte processing chunks align with common cache line sizes
- Prefetch strategy optimized for aarch64 memory hierarchy
- Reduced random memory access patterns

## Testing and Validation

The implementation includes comprehensive tests:
- `test_v8_optimizations_large_string()`: Tests SIMD path activation
- `test_v8_edge_cases()`: Validates corner cases and boundary conditions
- Existing tests ensure compatibility with `serde_json` output

## Future Optimization Opportunities

1. **Adaptive Prefetching**: Adjust prefetch distance based on detected memory patterns
2. **Specialized UTF-8 Handling**: Optimize for common Unicode patterns
3. **Branch-Free Escape Generation**: Further reduce branching in escape logic
4. **Memory Pool Allocation**: Reuse buffers for repeated operations

## Compatibility

- Full backward compatibility with existing API
- Identical output to `serde_json::to_string()`
- Only affects aarch64 builds (other architectures use fallback)
- No breaking changes to public interface
